An intelligent IoT device built using the Maixduino Kit for AI + IoT, integrating voice recognition and motion detection to interact with Home Assistant via MQTT. The assistant recognizes specific voice commands, detects motion, and provides visual feedback through four white LEDs and two vertical RGB LED light bars. It updates the state of various entities in Home Assistant, enabling automation and enhancing user interaction with the smart home environment.

   ```
   Port: Select Maixduino COM port
   Baud Rate: 115200
   Data Bits: 8
   Stop Bits: 1
   Parity: None
   ```

2. **Buffer Settings**
   - Set buffer size to 75000
   - Enable "Capture to Text File"
   - Clear buffer between recordings

### Reset Procedure for Voice Model Recording

1. **Preparation**
   - Locate labeled reset and GND wires
   - Ensure clean wire ends
   - Have recording script ready

2. **Recording Process**
   - Touch reset and GND wires together briefly
   - Wait for LED confirmation of reboot
   - Begin recording when prompted
   - Maintain consistent voice level
   - Complete all 6 samples
   - Save file with descriptive name

3. **Safety Notes**
   - Keep wire ends separated when not in use
   - Consider adding small connectors
   - Avoid touching other components
   - Keep wires away from interference sources
